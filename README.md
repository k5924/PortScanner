# PortScanner

## Introduction

This is a simple portscanner which will scan for open ports on a specified lan IP address. Threading has been used to improve the execution time of the application. You can specify the number of threads via the CLI after running the python script.


## Usage

You will be asked to type in an IP address, the port to start the search at, the port to end the search at and the number of threads you wish to allocate to the application. All you need to do is run the app and you will be greeted with these options.
